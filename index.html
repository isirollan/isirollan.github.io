        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Mountain biker and artist in my free time, committed product manager during the weekdays. I have six years of experience and I thrive in fast-paced and challenging environments. Passionate about fintech and innovation, I love turning complex problems into elegant solutions and leading cross-functional teams to success.</p> 
        <p>I am looking to work in the U.S. as a Product Manager focused on solving climate change-related problems. To that end, I recently joined the 6th cohort of the Climatebase fellowship to expand my climate knowledge and network.</p> 
        <p>I excel at translating complex problems into simple tasks and leading multiple projects simultaneously. With excellent interpersonal skills, I am an efficient leader and communicator for both business and engineering teams. I am a fast learner who quickly adapts to changes and understands how to apply new concepts effectively. My structured and organized approach ensures that I consistently deliver high-quality results.</p>
        <p> I graduated on May 2024 from University of California, Berkeley with a Master's in <a href="https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/programs/mims">Information Management and Systems</a> with a certification in Applied Data Science.</p>
        <p>I coded this webpage myself!</p>

            <h3>Refiberd Tag Reader (2024)</h3>
            <p>This was the final project to graduate from MIMS. We partnered with Refiberd, a company based in Oakland, California, that is using high-end technology to identify fabric composition.
                To launch this product to the market, they need to train a Machine learning model with as much data as possible. The objective of the project was to replace labeling samples by hand to an automated process.
            </p>
            <p>Through this project we managed to reduce work force required to collect training data labels by <strong>50%</strong>.</p>
