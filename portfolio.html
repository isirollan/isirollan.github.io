                        <p><span class="image left"><img src="images/thumbs/capstone.jpg" alt="user flow" /></span> Refiberd, an early-stage start-up in the textile recycling space, is using its proprietary supervised learning algorithm to automate and improve the accuracy of end-of-life fabric sorting processes. The model is only as good as their training set but gets better with each new sample it is trained on. However, the label capture process is manual and requires 50% of their workforce to conduct tedious dictation into an Excel spreadsheet.</p>
                        <p><span class="image right"><img src="images/thumbs/model.jpg" alt="model" /></span>Our team built a web-based application that automates the label capture process, which expedites and reduces the resources required to expand this portion of their training dataset by 50%. Our intervention was implemented using Amazon Web Services, and a pre-trained model was used to create our proprietary model to identify the relevant text in the tags.<br/>
                            I was responsible for the webpage development where the solution was hosted.</p>

Using Natural Language Processing, we classified the different posts as kind and not kind and we analyzed the results throughout the years. We used our trained BERT
                            classifier (batch size = 32, max tokens = 256) to predict the Kind vs Not Kind labels for all the 5942 responses.</p>
                            <p>While our top accuracy score is not extremely high
                                and requires further development, with 86% we      
                                can obtain a strong enough indication of the actual levels of kindness we see in our larger dataset 
                                of Reddit responses, showing that kindness has declined in general and had some increase since COVID.</p>

                            - We started with problem interviews that made us shift from what we thought the problem was to a different one.<br/>
                            -  We created our mock-up and no-code app with Adalo.<br/>

                            - We created and presented our Pitch.<br/>
